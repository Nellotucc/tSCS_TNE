first pulse to be discarted since its always 15mA artifact

T12-L1 big electrode: threshold 45 mA only distal muscles
problems at T12-L1 big electrode: current 45 rep1, 40 rep 2 rep3

small elec:
yellow 1 : BAD
red line threshold very high makes problems.
problems : 40 rep 3, 55 rep 1

yellow 2 : proximal avant distal

yellow 3 : general

black :tema si  distal

yellow 3 verterbrae : 
yellow1 : left in the real time folder 30-35 is 50-55, 40-45 is 35-40... problem current 55 rep1,rep2
yellow2 : right
